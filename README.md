## 🔐 OAuth Redirect Pages

These URLs are used by the eBay Developer Program to complete the authorization flow:

- **Privacy Policy**  
  https://carddealfinder.github.io/privacy

- **OAuth Success Redirect**  
  https://carddealfinder.github.io/auth-success

- **OAuth Decline Redirect**  
  https://carddealfinder.github.io/auth-denied

These pages do not collect personal data; they only display confirmation messages and allow the application to complete the OAuth onboarding flow.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (backend and API integration)
- **eBay Buy API (Browse API)**
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting documentation
